It is the end. Remember 'bout an existence of A-bombs. They're look at us.
As an another form of a woman's shoe heel.

* some shit happen - but, in a true, more than shit happen. The first shit is -
my FAT32-partitions are <VERY censored>, so I dealed with a partitioning by the
whole day. Then, my mobo's north bridge is overheated (+78 C), 'cause I've bought
a defective one. But while resellers says what it's all right with my mobo,
and while I dealing with 'em trying to get my money back or exchange that defective
mobo with a new another one, I've got Epox on KT400A, ~ $60. Good enough for me.
But, agpgart module refuses to work correctly - I haven't hardware acceleration.
More of than - there are strange screen artifacts from time to time. So now I've
changed drivers, turned off agpgart-module and waiting for new disasters or
miracle. Just stability - that what I want.
