TO DO:
//just ideas (outdated)

Interesting:

* better ODT parser
* session manager (window with a list of session files and buttons: delete, add)

Boring:

* text to speech (speaks, festival)
* better parsing of the compiler output (jump to prev or next error)
* Unicode characters table
* TEA uptime status
* macros in templates
* automatically find the right tab size for a document
* improve the Search/Replace window
* put "Search in files" code to the thread
* use new tooltips API

------- GTK+ 2.6+ stuff:
* use g_remove to remove directories and files
* gtk_combo_box_get_active_text
-----------------------------------

TO FIX:

spellcheck don't work with some syntax hl? (sometimes, I need to inspect it)
